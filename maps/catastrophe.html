		<h1>Catastrophe</h1>
		<p>Catastrophe is a game all about survival! A few random catastrophes are chosen before the game starts, and you will have to survive the next three minutes. There are 20 catastrophes in total, and they range from regular storms to gold slowly spreading over the world! There are a few options to spice up the game, as well! If you don't like the randomness, select one of the presets. Or make the game competitive, by enabling the Last Man Standing option! Maybe you can disable the power-ups, if you don't want a direct way to mess with other players? How about more catastrophes at once? Maybe four, or five?</p>
